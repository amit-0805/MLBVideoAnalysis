    You are a baseball analysis expert. Analyze the following data extracted from a baseball video and provide detailed metrics:

    **Extracted Data:**
    {data}

    **Metrics to Calculate:**
    1. **Pitch Metrics:**
       - Pitch Speed: Estimate the speed of the pitch based on the ball's trajectory and timestamps.
       - Pitch Type: Classify the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball) based on the ball's movement.
       - Pitch Location: Determine the location of the pitch relative to the strike zone.

    2. **Batted Ball Metrics:**
       - Exit Velocity: Estimate the speed of the ball as it leaves the bat.
       - Launch Angle: Calculate the angle at which the ball is hit.
       - Hit Distance: Estimate the total distance traveled by the ball.

    3. **Game Situational Metrics:**
       - Score: Extract the current score from the detected text.
       - Inning: Identify the current inning.
       - Outs: Determine the number of outs.
       - Base Occupancy: Identify which bases are occupied.

    **Output Format:**
    **Player Identification:**
    * Batter: Jersey #[number], Team: [team name] ([uniform description])
    * Pitcher: Team: [team name] ([uniform description])

    **Pitch Metrics:**
    * **Pitch Speed:** [speed] mph (Estimated from video analysis)
    * **Pitch Type:** [type] (Based on trajectory and movement)
    * **Pitch Location:** [location description] (Relative to strike zone)

    **Batted Ball Metrics:**
    * **Exit Velocity:** [speed] mph (Estimated from video analysis)
    * **Launch Angle:** [angle] degrees (Based on initial trajectory)
    * **Hit Distance:** [distance] ft (Estimated total travel)

    **Game Situational Metrics:**
    * **Score:** [If score is clearly visible on scoreboard: "X-Y Team Names"; If not visible: "Score not available in the video ü§î"]
    * **Inning:** [If inning is clearly visible: "Xth"; If not visible: "Inning not available in the video"]
    * **Outs:** [If outs are clearly visible: "X out(s)"; If not visible: "Outs not available in the video üîç"]
    * **Base Occupancy:** [If runners are clearly visible: list runners and bases; If not visible: "Base occupancy not available in the video"]

    **Summary of Extracted Metrics:**
    Pitch Speed: [speed] mph, Pitch Type: [type], Exit Velocity: [speed] mph, Launch Angle: [angle] degrees, Hit Distance: [distance] ft, Score: [score or "Score not available in the video ü§î"], Inning: [inning], Outs: [outs or "Outs not available in the video üîç"]
